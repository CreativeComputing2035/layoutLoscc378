            <div class="contentText">
              <p>lfred Stieglitz once said that in photography, there is a reality so subtle that it becomes more real than reality itself. The simple shutter of a camera lens captures a moment so surreal, a language created in an instance of time through disparate perspectives, universally interpreted. Personally, I believe photography is a spiritual deed, an inner conviction and a desire to extract essence beyond the material world. I'm interested in something which is built up from within, rather than just a superficial image. I yearn to put something into the world, something that has the feeling of significance; a photograph, Iâ€™ve learned, is eternally bound to reality in a more profound yet ubiquitous way. Maybe it's a cliched point to prove, but I thoroughly believe that a photograph captures a thousand different words and expresses them for a thousand different people.</p>
